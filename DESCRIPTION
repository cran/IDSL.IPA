Description: A sophisticated pipeline for processing
    high-resolution LC/MS data to extract signals of organic compounds. The
    package performs isotope pairing, peak detection, alignment, RT correction,
    gap filling, peak annotation and visualization of extracted ion chromatograms and total ion chromatograms.
